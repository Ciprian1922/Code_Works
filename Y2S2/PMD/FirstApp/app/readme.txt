Compute Pi:

Value: "pi"
Approximation: 0.001
Compute Square Root:

Value: "sqrt"
Approximation: Enter the number for which you want to compute the square root (e.g., 16)
Compute Factorial:

Value: "factorial"
Approximation: Enter the number for which you want to compute the factorial (e.g., 5)
Compute Trigonometric Functions:

Value: "sin", "cos", or "tan"
Approximation: Enter the angle in degrees for which you want to compute the trigonometric function (e.g., 45 for sine)
Compute Exponential Function:

Value: "exp"
Approximation: Enter the number for which you want to compute the exponential value (e.g., 2)
Custom Computation:

Value: Enter a custom mathematical expression (e.g., "2 * (3 + 5)")
Approximation: Not applicable
Input: The user enters a value and an approximation into the input fields.
Processing: When the user clicks the "Compute" button, the app processes the input based on the specified functionality.
Computation: If the value is recognized (e.g., "pi"), the app performs the corresponding computation (e.g.,
 approximation of pi using the Leibniz formula).
Display: The computed result is displayed in the TextView. If the value is unrecognized, an error message is displayed.
