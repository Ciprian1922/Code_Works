2. The following is a sample of prices, rounded to the nearest cent,
charged per gallon of standard gasoline in the San Francisco Bay area
in May 1991:
121, 119, 117, 121, 120, 120, 118, 124, 123, 139, 120,
115, 117, 121, 123, 120, 123, 118, 117, 122, 122, 119
(a) Construct a frequency histogram for this data set.
(b) Construct a frequency polygon.
(c) Construct a stem-and-leaf plot.
(d) Does any data value seem out of the ordinary? If so, explain whyw

a)

library(ggplot2)

prices <- c(121, 119, 117, 121, 120, 120, 118, 124, 123, 139, 120, 115, 117, 121, 123, 120, 123, 118, 117, 122, 122, 119)

#Construct a frequency histogram
histogram <- ggplot(data = data.frame(prices), aes(x = prices)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black", aes(y = ..count..)) +
  labs(title = "Frequency Histogram of Gasoline Prices",
       x = "Price (cents per gallon)",
       y = "Frequency")

b)
#Construct a frequency polygon
polygon <- ggplot(data = data.frame(prices), aes(x = prices)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Frequency Polygon of Gasoline Prices",
       x = "Price (cents per gallon)",
       y = "Frequency")

print(histogram)
print(polygon)

c)
stem_leaf <- stem(prices)
stem_leaf


d)
outlier <- boxplot(prices, plot = FALSE)$out
if (length(outlier) > 0) {
  print(paste("Outlier detected at value:", outlier))
  # Explanation or further analysis can be done here
} else {
  print("No outlier detected.")
}


3. The following frequency table presents the number of female suicides
that took place in eight German states over 14 years.
Number of suicides per year 01234 5 6 7 8 9 10
Frequency 9 19 17 20 15 118235 3
Thus, for instance, there were a total of 20 cases in which states had
3 suicides in a year.
(a) How many suicides were reported over the 14 years?
(b) Represent the above data in a histogram.

data
suicides <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
frequency <- c(9, 19, 17, 20, 15, 11, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0)

a) calculate total number of suicides reported over 14 years
total_suicides <- sum(suicides * frequency)
cat("Total number of suicides reported over 14 years:", total_suicides, "\n")

b) ) Create a histogram
# Convert the frequency table to a data frame
df <- data.frame(suicides = suicides, frequency = frequency)

# Create the histogram
histogram <- ggplot(data = df, aes(x = factor(suicides), y = frequency)) +
  geom_col(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Female Suicides Over 14 Years",
       x = "Number of Suicides per Year",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

print(histogram)
