 located in New York has been receiving complaints about the length
 of time it takes for customers in California to receive their orders. To
 learn more about this potential problem, the manager chose a random

==== 2. A study was instituted to learn how the diets of women changed
 during the winter and the summer. A random group of 12 women
 were observed during the month of July, and the percentage of
 each woman’s calories that came from fat was determined. Similar
 observations were made on a different randomly selected group of
 size 12 during the month of January. Suppose the results were as
 follows:
 July: 32.2, 27.4, 28.6, 32.4, 40.5, 26.2, 29.4, 25.8, 36.6, 30.3,
 28.5, 32.0
 January: 30.5, 28.4, 40.2, 37.6, 36.5, 38.8, 34.7, 29.5, 29.7, 37.2,
 41.5, 37.0
 Test the hypothesis that the mean fat intake is the same for both
 months. Use the
 (a) 5 percent
 (b) 1 percent
 level of significance.


# Data for July and January
july <- c(32.2, 27.4, 28.6, 32.4, 40.5, 26.2, 29.4, 25.8, 36.6, 30.3, 28.5, 32.0)
january <- c(30.5, 28.4, 40.2, 37.6, 36.5, 38.8, 34.7, 29.5, 29.7, 37.2, 41.5, 37.0)

# Perform the two-sample t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(july, january, var.equal = TRUE)

# Print the results of the t-test
print(t_test_result)

# Check the results at the 5% level of significance
if(t_test_result$p.value < 0.05) {
  cat("At the 5% level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis.\n")
} else {
  cat("At the 5% level of significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n")
}

# Check the results at the 1% level of significance
if(t_test_result$p.value < 0.01) {
  cat("At the 1% level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis.\n")
} else {
  cat("At the 1% level of significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n")
}


At the 1% level of significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.


==== 2. A shoe salesman claims that using his company’s running shoes will
 result, on average, in faster times. To check this claim, a track coach
 assembled a team of 10 sprinters. The coach randomly divided the
 runners into two groups of size 5. The members of the first group then
 ran 100 yards, using their usual running shoes; the members of the
 second group ran 100 yards, using the company’s shoes. After time
 was given for rest, the group who ran with their usual shoes changed
 into the company’s shoes and members of the other group changed
 to their usual shoes. Then they all ran another dash of 100 yards. The
 following data resulted:
 Racer
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 Time (old shoes) 10.5 10.3 11.0 10.9 11.3 9.9 10.1 10.7 12.2 11.1
 Time (new shoes) 10.3 10.0 10.6 11.1 11.0 9.8 10.2 10.5 11.8 10.5
 Do these data prove the claim of the salesman that the company’snew
 shoes result, on average, in lower times? Use the 10 percent level of
 significance. What about at the 5 percent level?
 


# Times for old and new shoes
times_old <- c(10.5, 10.3, 11.0, 10.9, 11.3, 9.9, 10.1, 10.7, 12.2, 11.1)
times_new <- c(10.3, 10.0, 10.6, 11.1, 11.0, 9.8, 10.2, 10.5, 11.8, 10.5)

# Perform the paired t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(times_old, times_new, paired = TRUE)

# Print the results of the t-test
print(t_test_result)

# Check the results at the 10% level of significance
if(t_test_result$p.value < 0.10) {
  cat("At the 10% level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis.\n")
} else {
  cat("At the 10% level of significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n")
}

# Check the results at the 5% level of significance
if(t_test_result$p.value < 0.05) {
  cat("At the 5% level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis.\n")
} else {
  cat("At the 5% level of significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n")
}

At the 5% level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis.
