4. For evalunting the effectiveness of a processor for a certain type of tasks, we recorded the CPU time for 20 randomly chosen jobs. It is known that the CPU time has a normal distribution with mean 20(s) and standard deviation 8(s). Compute the probability that the average CPU for the selected jobs (the sample mean) takes valves in the interval [18.22]. Round your answer to 3 decimal places.
