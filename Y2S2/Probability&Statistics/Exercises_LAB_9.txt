2. A previous sample of fish in Lake Michigan indicated that the mean
polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentration per fish was 11.2 parts
per million with a standard deviation of 2 parts per million. Suppose a
new random sample of 10 fish has the following concentrations:
11.5, 12.0, 11.6, 11.8, 10.4, 10.8, 12.2, 11.9, 12.4, 12.6
Assume that the standard deviation has remained equal to 2 parts per
million, and test the hypothesis that the mean PCB concentration has
also remained unchanged at 11.2 parts per million. Use the 5 percent
level of significance.


# Sample data
sample_data <- c(11.5, 12.0, 11.6, 11.8, 10.4, 10.8, 12.2, 11.9, 12.4, 12.6)

# Given values
population_mean <- 11.2
population_sd <- 2
alpha <- 0.05

# Sample mean
sample_mean <- mean(sample_data)

# Sample size
n <- length(sample_data)

# Calculate the z-score
z <- (sample_mean - population_mean) / (population_sd / sqrt(n))

# Calculate the p-value
p_value <- 2 * pnorm(-abs(z))

# Print the results
cat("Sample mean:", sample_mean, "\n")
cat("Z-score:", z, "\n")
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")

# Determine whether to reject the null hypothesis
if (p_value < alpha) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence to suggest the mean PCB concentration has changed.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence to suggest the mean PCB concentration has changed.\n")
}





6. A farmer claims to be able to produce larger tomatoes. To test this
claim, a tomato variety that has a mean diameter size of 8.2 centimeters with a standard deviation of 2.4 centimeters is used. If a sample
of 36 tomatoes yielded a sample mean of 9.1 centimeters, does this
prove that the mean size is indeed larger? Assume that the population
standard deviation remains equal to 2.4, and use the 5 percent level of
significance.





# Given values
population_mean <- 8.2
sample_mean <- 9.1
population_sd <- 2.4
n <- 36
alpha <- 0.05

# Calculate the z-score
z <- (sample_mean - population_mean) / (population_sd / sqrt(n))

# Calculate the critical value for a one-tailed test
z_critical <- qnorm(1 - alpha)

# Calculate the p-value
p_value <- 1 - pnorm(z)

# Print the results
cat("Sample mean:", sample_mean, "\n")
cat("Z-score:", z, "\n")
cat("Critical value:", z_critical, "\n")
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")

# Determine whether to reject the null hypothesis
if (z > z_critical) {
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence to suggest the mean size of the tomatoes is larger.\n")
} else {
  cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence to suggest the mean size of the tomatoes is larger.\n")
}





4. The number of lunches served daily at a school cafeteria last
year was normally distributed with mean 300. The menu has been
changed this year to healthier foods, and the administration wants
to test the hypothesis that the mean number of lunches sold is
unchanged. A sample of 12 days yielded the following number of
lunches sold:
312, 284, 281, 295, 306, 273, 264, 258, 301, 277, 280, 275
Is the hypothesis that the mean is equal to 300 rejected at the
(a) 10 percent
(b) 5 percent
(c) 1 percent
level of significance?

# Sample data
sample_data <- c(312, 284, 281, 295, 306, 273, 264, 258, 301, 277, 280, 275)

# Calculate sample mean and sample standard deviation
sample_mean <- mean(sample_data)
sample_sd <- sd(sample_data)

# Given values
population_mean <- 300
n <- length(sample_data)
alpha_levels <- c(0.10, 0.05, 0.01)

# Calculate sample mean and sample standard deviation
sample_mean <- mean(sample_data)
sample_sd <- sd(sample_data)

# Calculate the t-score
t_score <- (sample_mean - population_mean) / (sample_sd / sqrt(n))

# Calculate the p-value for the two-tailed test
p_value <- 2 * (1 - pt(abs(t_score), df = n - 1))

# Print the results
cat("Sample mean:", sample_mean, "\n")
cat("Sample standard deviation:", sample_sd, "\n")
cat("T-score:", t_score, "\n")
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")

# Determine whether to reject the null hypothesis at different significance levels
for (alpha in alpha_levels) {
  critical_value <- qt(1 - alpha / 2, df = n - 1)
  cat("Critical value at alpha =", alpha, ":", critical_value, "\n")
  if (abs(t_score) > critical_value) {
    cat("Reject the null hypothesis at alpha =", alpha, ".\n")
  } else {
    cat("Fail to reject the null hypothesis at alpha =", alpha, ".\n")
  }
}


1. A standard drug is known to be effective in 72 percent of cases in
which it is used to treat a certain infection. A new drug has been developed, and testing has found it to be effective in 42 cases out of 50.
Is this strong enough evidence to prove that the new drug is more
effective than the old one? Find the relevant p value.


# Given values
p0 <- 0.72
n <- 50
successes <- 42
phat <- successes / n

# Calculate the z-score
z <- (phat - p0) / sqrt((p0 * (1 - p0)) / n)

# Calculate the p-value for a one-tailed test
p_value <- 1 - pnorm(z)

# Print the results
cat("Sample proportion:", phat, "\n")
cat("Z-score:", z, "\n")
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")







15. Twenty-five percent of women of child-bearing age smoke. A scientist wanted to test the hypothesis that this is also the proportion of
smokers in the population of women who suffer ectopic pregnancies.
To do so, the scientist chose a random sample of 120 women who had
recently suffered an ectopic pregnancy. If 48 of these women turn out
to be smokers, what is the p value of the test of the hypothesis
H0: p = 0.25 against H1: p 
= 0.25
where p is the proportion of smokers in the population of women who
have suffered an ectopic pregnancy?




# Given values
p0 <- 0.25
n <- 120
successes <- 48
phat <- successes / n

# Calculate the z-score
z <- (phat - p0) / sqrt((p0 * (1 - p0)) / n)

# Calculate the p-value for a two-tailed test
p_value <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z)))

# Print the results
cat("Sample proportion:", phat, "\n")
cat("Z-score:", z, "\n")
cat("P-value:", p_value, "\n")



Since the p-value is much smaller than any common significance level (e.g., 0.05, 0.01), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the proportion of smokers among women who have suffered an ectopic pregnancy is significantly different from 25%.
