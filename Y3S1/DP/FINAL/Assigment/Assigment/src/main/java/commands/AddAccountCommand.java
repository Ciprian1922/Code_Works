//the Commander Pattern encapsulates requests as objects

// the sender (e.g., mediator) doesn't need to know the logic
// of the operation; it just executes commands

//commands can be stored, replayed, or rolled back,
// making them ideal for transactional systems

// adding new commands doesn't require modifying existing codeâ€”just
// create a new command class
