Project Title: Interactive Tree Data Structure Visualization for the Web

Short Description:
This web-based project will focus on creating an interactive platform that allows users to visualize and manipulate tree data structures like AVL trees and binary search trees or more data structures. The tool will be designed as a learning aid, enabling users to add, delete, and rebalance nodes in these trees, with clear, dynamic visuals to help explain how each operation affects the structure.

functionalities:

-Node Insertion and Deletion: Users can add and delete nodes from AVL and binary trees, with visual feedback showing rebalancing steps.
-Real-Time Tree Visualization: A responsive, graphical display of the tree structure that adjusts instantly to user inputs, showing how each change impacts the tree.
-Traversal Animations: Visual animations for different tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order), providing insights into tree traversal processes.
-Educational Feedback: Information panels or tooltips that provide explanations of AVL rotations, balancing factors, and tree properties, enhancing the educational value of the tool.

Technology Stack:
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js for building an interactive, responsive user interface.
-Graph Visualization: D3.js for rendering and animating the tree structures, with SVG elements for smooth, scalable graphics.
-Styling and Animations: CSS and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for creating engaging, smooth animations that enhance the user experience.
-User Interaction and Event Handling: JavaScript for capturing user inputs and triggering visualization changes in real-time.
-Testing: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing to ensure interface components work as expected and interactions remain consistent.
