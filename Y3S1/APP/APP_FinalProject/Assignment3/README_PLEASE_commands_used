For my own convenience, I used commands in powershell to create and modify everything, it works.

they are being created in the folder directories and I also did an example with my_directory to show it how it works


-list all directories in the artifact repository
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/ -Method GET

-display the content of the response(same command but contents only)
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/ -Method GET).Content


==RELEVANT==


-add an artifact  (use your path)
curl.exe -X POST -F "file=@C:\Users\popa_\Desktop\GitHub_UVT\Code_Works\Y3S1\APP\APP_FinalProject\Assignment3\example.txt" http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/


- list directories
curl.exe -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/


- list the artifacts in the directory
curl.exe -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/

- fetch an artifact
curl.exe -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/example.txt -o downloaded_File_wow.txt


-replace an artifact
curl.exe -X PUT -F "file=@C:\Users\popa_\Desktop\GitHub_UVT\Code_Works\Y3S1\APP\APP_FinalProject\Assignment3\example2XD.txt" http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/example.txt


-delete an specific artifact
curl.exe -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/example2XD.txt


-delete an entire directory
curl.exe -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/
