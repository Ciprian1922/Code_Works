For my own convenience, I used commands in powershell to create and modify everything, it works.

they are being created in the folder directories and I also did an example with my_directory to show it how it works


Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/ -Method GET


(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/ -Method GET).Content





add an artifact:

curl.exe -X POST -F "file=@C:\Users\popa_\Desktop\GitHub_UVT\Code_Works\Y3S1\APP\APP_FinalProject\Assignment3\example.txt" http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/



curl.exe -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/          - list directories


curl.exe -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/    - list the artifacts in the directory


curl.exe -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/example.txt -o downloaded_File_wow.txt     - fetch an artifact



-replace an artifact
curl.exe -X PUT -F "file=@C:\Users\popa_\Desktop\GitHub_UVT\Code_Works\Y3S1\APP\APP_FinalProject\Assignment3\example2XD.txt" http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/example.txt




-delete an specific artifact
curl.exe -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/example2XD.txt


-delete an entire directory
curl.exe -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/artefacts/my_directory/
