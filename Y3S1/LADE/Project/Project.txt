Value Problem

The initial value problem (IVP),
(7) dy
dx = 3y2/3 , y122 = 0 ,
which was discussed in Example 9 and Problem 29 of Section 1.2, is an example of an IVP that has
more than one solution. The goal of this project is to find all the solutions to (7) on 1 - ∞, + ∞2.
It turns out that there are infinitely many! These solutions can be obtained by concatenating the
three functions 1x - a23

for x 6 a, the constant 0 for a ... x ... b, and 1x - b23

for x 7 b, where

a ... 2 ... b, as can be seen by completing the following steps:
(a) Show that if y = ƒ1x2 is a solution to the differential equation dy>dx = 3y 2>3
that
is not zero on an open interval I, then on this interval ƒ1x2 must be of the form
ƒ1x2 = 1x - c23

for some constant c not in I.

(b) Prove that if y = ƒ1x2 is a solution to the differential equation dy>dx = 3y 2>3
on
1 - ∞, + ∞2 and ƒ1a2 = ƒ1b2 = 0, where a 6 b, then ƒ1x2 = 0 for a ... x ... b.
[Hint: Consider the sign of ƒ′.]
(c) Now let y = g1x2 be a solution to the IVP (7) on 1 - ∞, + ∞2. Of course g122 = 0.
If g vanishes at some point x 7 2, then let b be the largest of such points; otherwise, set
b = 2. Similarly, if g vanishes at some point x 6 2, then let a be the smallest (furthest
to the left) of such points; otherwise, set a = 2. Here we allow b = + ∞ and a = - ∞.
(Because g is a continuous function, it can be proved that there always exist such largest
and smallest points.) Using the results of parts (a) and (b) prove that if both a and b are
finite, then g has the following form:
g1x2 = •
1x - a23 if x ... a
0 if a 6 x ... b
1x - b23 if x 7 b
What is the form of g if b = + ∞? If a = - ∞? If both b = + ∞ and a = - ∞?
(d) Verify directly that the above concatenated function g is indeed a solution to the IVP (7)

for all choices of a and b with a ... 2 ... b. Also sketch the graph of several of the solu-
tion function g in part (c) for various values of a and b, including infinite values.

We have analyzed here a first-order IVP that not only fails to have a unique solution but has a
solution set consisting of a doubly infinite family of functions (with a and b as the two parameters).
