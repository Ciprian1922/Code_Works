#analysis
# 1.Are there equilibrium solutions?
#from observing the graph, we can conclude that there are no constant equilibrium solutions
#where y remains fixed over time, the system displays oscillatory behavior, 
#following the periodic nature of sin(t), the solution curves do not settle at any particular 
#value of y, but continuously oscillate as t progresses

#2.Appearance of the solution curves:
#  -the solution curves show oscillatory behavior that follows the periodic nature of sin(t)
#  -the slope of the direction field depends on t, not on y, this results in horizontal oscillations
#  -the curves exhibit similar shapes, but their initial y-values shift them vertically
#  -since the differential equation depends only on t, each solution has the same shape but with a vertical shift
#  -there are no equilibrium points where the solution stays constant for all t

#overall behavior:
#  -all solutions oscillate based on the behavior of sin(t)
#  -no equilibrium solutions (constant y values) are possible, but the solutions repeat periodically
#  -the direction field shows arrows oscillating between positive and negative slopes
