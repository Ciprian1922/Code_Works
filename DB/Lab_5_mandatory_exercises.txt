Determine the validity of the following statements. Circle either True or False.
1.  Group functions work across many rows to produce one result.
  True
	Group functions summarize data from multiple rows into a single result, often used with the GROUP BY clause in SQL.
2.  Group functions include nulls in calculations.
  True
	Group functions consider NULL values when performing calculations, ensuring comprehensive results.
3.  The WHERE clause restricts rows prior to inclusion in a group calculation.
  True
	The WHERE clause filters rows before they are aggregated, controlling which data is included in group-level calculations.
4. Display the highest, lowest, sum, and average salary of all employees. Label the columns
  Maximum, Minimum, Sum, and Average, respectively. Round your results to the decimal
  position. Save your SQL statement in a file called p5q4.sql.
    Maximum  Minimum	Sum Average

5. Modify p5q4.sql to display the minimum, maximum, sum, and average salary for each job type.
  Resave to a file called p5q5.sql.  Rerun your query.
