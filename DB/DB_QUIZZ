1.Given that the data sample from above *
is representative for ALL functional
dependencies in the real dataset,
select which ones valid functional
dependencies in the dataset
Multiple options are possible
a.{BC} -> F
b.C->A
c.A->B
d.E->C
e.F->C
f.C->F
g.C->E
h.D->E

2.Suppose relation R(A, B, C) currently
has only the tuple (0,0,0) and it must
always satisfy the functional
dependencies A T B and B T C.
Which of the following tuples may be
inserted into R legally?
a.(0, 0, 1)
b.(0,0, 2)
c.(0, 1,0)
d.(1,1,0)

3.The candidate key of the relation R(A,B, C,D,E, F) is
a.{BC}
b.{ABC}
c.{BD}
d.{E}
e.{AB}
f.{AD}
g.{C}
h.{F}
i.{A}
j.{B}
k.{DB}
l.{D}
m.{AC}
