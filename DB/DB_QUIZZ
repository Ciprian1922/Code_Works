dependencies in the real dataset,

dependencies in the dataset

d.E->C
e.F->C
f.C->F
g.C->E
h.D->E

2.Suppose relation R(A, B, C) currently
has only the tuple (0,0,0) and it must
always satisfy the functional
dependencies A T B and B T C.
Which of the following tuples may be
inserted into R legally?
a.(0, 0, 1)
b.(0,0, 2)
c.(0, 1,0)
d.(1,1,0)

3.The candidate key of the relation R(A,B, C,D,E, F) is
a.{BC} --
b.{ABC}
c.{BD} --
d.{E}
e.{AB} --
f.{AD} --
g.{C}
h.{F}
i.{A} --
j.{B} --
k.{DB}
l.{D} --
m.{AC}

5. Given the table Products(id INT, description
NVARCHAR(512), category VARCHAR(128),
details JSON) in MySQL, write the SQL
statement that updates the resolution to
3840 x 2160' for all products in 'TV SET
category where resolution is '3820 x 21 60"
(Note: the <> is stored as a JSON property in
details column).

update products 
set details = json_set(details, '$.resolution', '3840 x 2160') 
where category = 'tv set' 
and json_extract(details, '$.resolution') = '3820 x 2160';

6. The relation R(A, B, C, D, E, F) is in the
following normal form
a.1NF  -- correct
b.2NF
c.3NF
d.4NF
e.BCNF

7. Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) with two
multi-valued dependencies: A + B,B + D and
no functional dependencies. Suppose we
decompose R into 4th Normal Form
Depending on the order in which we deal with
4NF violations, we can get different final
decompositions. Which one of the following
relation could be in the final 4NF
decomposition?
a.AC
b.ABCDE --
c.BD
d.ACDE --

8. Among the advantages of SQL are:
a.Impossible to model a relational database
using it
b.Complex queries cannot be computed
-- c.Simple queries can be used to retrieve data
quickly and efficiently
-- d.Easy to learn and almost every DBMS
supports it

9. Consider table R(A) containing {(3}, (4)}.
Suppose transaction T1 is "update T set
A=2*A; insert into R values (6)" and
transaction T2 is "select avg(A) from R; select
avg(A) from R". If transaction T2 executes
using "repeatable read", what are the possible
values returned by its SECOND statement?
a. 7
b. 6.66 --
c. 3.5
d. 10

10. Given HighSalary view created as below,
which of the following statements will be
rejected / accepted by the DBMS?
CREATE TABLE EmpSalary(EmpId INT, Salary INT);
ICREATE VIEW HighSalary
AS SELECT * FROM EmpSalary WHERE salary > 10000
WITH CHECK OPTION;
Accepted
Rejected
rej - UPDATE
HighSalary SET
salary =9500
WHERE EmpId=
1234
acc - UPDATE
HighSalary SET
salary =10500
WHERE Empld =
1234
rej - INSERT INTO
HighSalary(Empld,
salary) VALUES
(1234, 8000)
acc - INSERT INTO
HighSalary(Empld,
salary) VALUES
(123, 10000)
acc - DELETE FROM
HighSalary
WHERE
Empld=123

11. Consider a relational database schema for a
university management system with the
following tables:
1. **Student (StudentID, FirstName, LastName,
Address, Phone, DepartmentlD)**
Candidate Key: StudentID
2.**Course (CourselD, CourseName,
DepartmentID, InstructorlD)**
Candidate Key: CourselD
3. **Department (DepartmentID,
DepartmentName, Location)**
Candidate Key: DepartmentID
4. **Instructor (InstructorlD, FirstName,
LastName, DepartmentlD)**
Candidate Key: InstructorlD
The database is currently in 2nd Normal Form
(2NF). However, during a recent review, it was
identified that there are some potential issues
related to functional dependencies and partial
dependencies. Your task is to perform the
necessary transformations to bring the
database to at least 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
Identify the functional dependencies and
partial dependencies that violate the 3rd
Normal Form and perform the required normal
form transformations. Provide the resulting
tables with their attributes and any additional
tables created during the normalization
process.
Ensure that each table has a clearly defined
primary key, and foreign keys are appropriately
assigned. If any new tables are created during
the normalization process, specify their primary
and foreign keys as well
Explain each step of the normalization process
and justify your decisions:
