java ChatServer

java ChatClient

The client establishes a connection with the server using sockets (Socket class).
The client sends its username to the server.
The server creates a new thread to handle communication with this client (ClientHandler).
The server receives the username and informs all clients about the new connection.
The server and client can now exchange messages through their respective input and output streams (Scanner and PrintWriter).
When a client sends a message, it's received by the server's ClientHandler.
The server forwards this message to all clients, including the sender, and displays it in the server terminal along with the sender's details.
The process continues until a client disconnects, at which point the server removes the client from the list of active clients and informs the remaining clients about the disconnection.
